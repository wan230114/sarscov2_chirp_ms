In each of these conditions, bulk RNA seq was performed (input) and also RNA-seq after crosslinking and pulldown for the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.	Cell lines were cultured using standard media and passaging conditions.	total RNA	Sample proteins were digested and RNA was extracted via commercial spin column (Zymo).
